oneoff lets you write one-off code and run it instantly.

Install with 'pip install .' or 'python setup.py install'

Run with 'oneoff RUNNER'. It defaults to using the nano editor, which can be changed with the --editor EDITOR option.

Set RUNNER to '!' and it will open the last file you ran. Set RUNNER to 'EXPORT' and it will save the last file you ran elsewhere.

Your editor should be able to be run with "EDITOR FILE_PATH", and your runner should be able to be run with "RUNNER FILE_PATH".

Your runner is the command used to run your code, i.e. "python3" and your editor is the command used to run the editor, i.e. "nano", "vim"

(NOTE: This is only compatible with Linux and maybe macOS, which I haven't tested)
